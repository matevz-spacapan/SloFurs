    <h1>Rules of Conduct for SloFurs events and Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>The events are held with the intention to create a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere for participants. We try to avoid as many formalities and written rules as possible, depending on our participants' common sense. Nonetheless, we have noticed a need to prepare and publish these basic rules to avoid unnecessary complications regarding organization, participant conduct, or law abidance. As these rules are merely an outline, they contain guidelines for certain expected situations. In all other cases, the first three general rules apply. <b>Most of the time, common sense will help you decide what is acceptable and what is not. If in doubt, ask a member of the organization team.</b></p>
    <p><b>During each event, the latest published rules at the start of the event are in effect.</b></p>
    <p>Web sales on this website are managed by "Društvo SloFurs" (SloFurs association), Gregorčičeva ulica 33, 5000 Nova Gorica, Slovenia, identification number: 4121988000, tax number: 73456012, which is the provider of the services (referred also as the seller).</p>
    <h3>I. General rules</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>All members of the organization team and organizational sub-teams (referred to as the organizer) reserve the right to alter these Rules of conduct at any given time without prior announcement. Furthermore, we reserve the right to the full interpretation of these Rules of conduct, and in rare instances, their adaptation. The Rules of conduct are not debatable during events. In situations not covered by these Rules of conduct, only the organizer has full authority and power to make decisions. The organizer can reject any person's registration without explanation. Decisions made by the organizer are final.</li>
        <li>Any actions that interfere with the planned course of organization of an event, contradict the event's purpose, cause direct discomfort, in any way endanger or harm any participants, the venue, the surroundings of the event, or the public near the event will result in an immediate demand to leave the event. During the event, the valid legislation of the Republic of Slovenia applies, and any transgressions against the law will be immediately reported to the authorities. Furthermore, house rules set by the venue at which the event is held also apply. Personal disagreements that do not concern all participants will not be regarded by the organizer unless they lead to a violation of the Rules of conduct.</li>
        <li>Everyone is responsible for their own actions, even when under the influence of alcohol or other substances. The organizer is not liable for any injury or damage suffered by an participant during an event. All participants agree that their attendance may be revoked at any time (the participant will be demanded to leave the event), without reimbursement of costs, in case of a violation of the Rules of conduct.</li>

                    <p>In accordance to Slovenian law, <b>the consumer is not entitled to withdraw from the contract</b> for leisure services in which the contractor undertakes to fulfill his obligation at a specific date or within a specified time limit. This means that all purchases are binding and final no matter how you completed the purchase (in person or online). <b>In other words; you cannot return any purchased tickets for any event and demand a refund for them no mater where it's being held.</b></p>
                    <p>In the case that an event is cancelled or has its date or location changed, the seller is responsible for handling the situation and refunds. Upon the occurrence of these circumstances, the seller will inform ticket buyers as soon as possible regarding refund options. <b>If the buyer does not request a refund within 14 days of these changes being made public, he/she agrees with the aforementioned changes and after that period he/she is again not entitled to a refund.</b></p>
                    <p>In the event of a refund, ticket holders will receive a refund, without any further request, in the same way they paid the tickets. This invalidates the ticket.</p>
                    <p>Minimal or justified changes to the event are reserved, e.g. shifting the start of the event for a few hours of altering the programme of the event. In the event of cancellation, change of the date or location of the event or change in the program, any additional costs you may incur (e.g. travel, hotel, delivery, payment, etc.) will not be reimbursed.</p>
                    <p>The seller does his best to ensure that all prices on the website are accurate, but errors can still occur. If the seller detects a mistake in the ticket price already purchased by the buyer, the seller will inform the buyer as soon as possible and give the buyer the opportunity to re-confirm the order at the right price or cancel it. Should the seller fail to contact the buyer, the buyer agrees to treat the seller's ticket as canceled. If the buyer chooses to cancel the ticket at the wrong price after his payment has already been made, the seller will refund them.</p>
                    <p>Complaints are resolved by the ticket buyer and the seller within the complaint period, which is eight days from the receipt of the written complaint by the complainant. Within this period, the seller is obliged to provide the complainant with a written or oral response to the submitted complaint.</p>

                    The organizer determines sanctions based on the severity of the violation.
                    <ol>
                        <li>For minor violations, you will initially receive a warning from the organizer. <b>A system of two warnings applies to minor violations</b>, with the first being a notice or informative warning, and the second being a warning prior to sanctions.</li>
                        <li>More serious violations or repeated minor violations will result in a demand for the participant to leave the event. The organizer may also, at their discretion, issue a permanent ban from attending any future events.</li>
                        <li>The organizer has the right to impose special conditions on individual participants in order to maintain order and enforce the rules and conditions.</li>
                        <li>If you believe you have been unjustly sanctioned, please contact the lead organizer.</li>
                        <li>In cases of violence or if a participant refuses to leave the event upon the organizer's request, the organizer reserves the right to, in exceptional circumstances (if the participant poses a threat to other participants, organizers, or other individuals or animals), involve the appropriate authorities to remove the participant from the event. This will result in a permanent ban from attending future events.</li>
                        <li>In the event that involvement of the relevant authorities is necessary, the violator is responsible for covering the costs.</li>
